# Flourite
setup using: ``npx @pickle-string/fluorite-stack``

you can then run the project using: ``npm run dev``

## why did i make this?
I like seperation in my code, I don't want my js mixed with my css, and I don't want my client mixed with my server. so i thought an npx package that created a mono repo for server and client could be useful!
